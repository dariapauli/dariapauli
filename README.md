🌱 Junior Full-Stack Web-Dev and Comic-Artist 🌱

🏡 I’m currently working on a project called ✨Local Loop✨ with my teammembers @JCorts1, @Lukas-Bertram and @sophiernh. It's a mobile web application for neighbours that recently moved into a new neighbourhood, or for anyone that wants to connect with their neighbours. You can create small events, ask for help or offer your help to somebody. 
This is a project that all of us have poured a lot of love into and will continue to do so in the future.

🪩 Fun fact: In my freetime I am a DJane that loves Drum and Bass
